libwspcodec (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took out wsp_text_header_iter stuff.
    Those functions were parsing a strange representation of textual
    Content-Type like headers but the syntax they understood wasn't
    HTTP compliant. This is pretty useless, has nothing to do with
    WSP and doesn't belong here.

libwspcodec (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made content type field configurable.
    This resolves conflict between WSP Content-Type and X-Mms-Report-Allowed
    headers (both are equal 0x11)
